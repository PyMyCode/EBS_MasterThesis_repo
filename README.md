## Comparison of Different Regression Methodologies for Rental Price Prediction in the German Residential Market

### Abstract
In the modern era of internet and digitalization, house listing websites have become
sources of rich real estate data. This data is updated in real-time, is high in volume and
includes rich geo-location information. However, to analyse such large datasets, robust
methodologies and tools are required which are far more complex than traditional hedonic
regression models. The aim of this paper is to use this data from house listing websites to
compare different parametric and nonparametric regression models using machine learn-
ing techniques to predict rental prices in the German residential market. Six machine
learning algorithms, including Ordinary Least Square Linear regression, Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent regression, Elastic Net Stochastic Gradient Descent regression, Linear Sup-
port Vector regression, Random Forest regression and XGBoost regression, were trained
and compared. Results show that nonparametric models outperform parametric models.
Amongst the nonparametric models, XGBoost regression performs the best. Also, spatial
attributes have the highest impact on the prediction power the models.

### Models implemented:
- Ordinary Least Square Linear Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression
- Elastic Net SGD Regression
- Linear Support Vector Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost Regresion
